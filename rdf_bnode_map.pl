/** <module> RDF term: Blank node mapping

Since literals are not allowed to occur in the subject position
 of RDF triples, blank nodes need to be associated with them in order
 to be able to form propositions that state things *about* literals.

Blank nodes and IRIs should also be mapped onto a single blank node
 in simple entailment, in order to ascertain that the original graph
 is a proper instance of every materialized graph.

The graph argument is required in blank node maps,
 since identical blank node labels that occur in different graphs may denote
 different resources.
